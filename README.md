## <p align="center"><strong>🔮 Documentation for Terraform on AWS. 🔮 </strong></p>

### Objective 🎯 
This guide will present a simple project goal - using TF to Deploy an AWS service, and the necessary components for achieving it.

In AWS, using Terraform, we will do the following:
- Create vpc
- Create internet gateway
- Create custom route table
- Create a subnet
- Associate subnet with route table
- Create Secuirty group
- Create a network interface
- Assign an elastic ip to the network interface
- Create Ubuntu server and install/enable apache2 as web server

### Get started  🚀
Download and setup Terraform on Ubuntu/Windows.

(Since I'm using both linux and win machines for my projects, I want the flexibility of being able to use it in both environments.)

### How to install on Windows 10 -
Run PowerShell as an admin, to have the permissions to edit the environment variables.



```bash
# Download Terraform, specifically for this example I'm using 1.7.5 and D:\Projects\Terraform as a project path folder
wget -O D:\Projects\Terraform\terraform_1.7.5_windows_amd64.zip https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.7.5/terraform_1.7.5_windows_amd64.zip

# Unzip
Get-ChildItem 'D:\Projects\Terraform\terraform_1.7.5_windows_amd64.zip' -Filter *.zip | Expand-Archive -DestinationPath 'D:\Projects\Terraform\' -Force

# Define the path to the Terraform executable
$terraformPath = "D:\Projects\Terraform"

# Add the Terraform directory to the system PATH environment variable
$currentPath = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "Machine")
$newPath = $currentPath + ";$terraformPath"
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", $newPath, "Machine")

# refresh current powershell session for the changes to take affect
$env:Path = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path","Machine")

# To see if it worked, try getting the version
terraform -v

output-
"Terraform v1.7.5
on windows_amd64"
```

### How to install on Ubuntu 22.04 -

```bash
# Download Terraform, specifically for this example I'm using 1.7.5 and /data/terraform/ as a project path folder
wget -O /data/terraform/terraform_1.7.5_linux_amd64.zip https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.7.5/terraform_1.7.5_linux_amd64.zip

# Unzip
unzip terraform_1.7.5_linux_amd64.zip

# Move Terraform exe to /usr/local/bin/ to be globally accessible
sudo mv terraform /usr/local/bin/terraform

# To see if it worked, try using it from home directory
cd ~
terraform -v

output-
"Terraform v1.7.5
on linux_amd64"
```

### AWS Console setup 💻
In the upper right corner, select your preferable region (I'm using eu-central-1, as shown in picture below)
![image](https://github.com/mz19933/Terraform_AWS/assets/61427854/b8d27fdf-f3db-4b8d-a515-b189d59b3792)

### Authentication 🔐
**Get your Access key ID and Secret Access key from your AWS profile**

Profile name -> security credentials -> Access keys -> Create access key -> Download .csv file \ copy the keys -> Done

We will then create an AWS credentials file, to store our keys securely AND NOT HARD CODE IT IN OUR TERRAFORM FILE.

AWS credentials stored in ~/.aws/credentials on Unix-like systems or %USERPROFILE%\.aws\credentials on Windows.

**Set up a Key Pairs(is needed for later steps)**

Console home -> All Services -> EC2

###   Project's steps🛠️

1) **Create vpc**
- [Terraform docs for vpc](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/vpc)
```bash
resource "aws_vpc" "prod-vpc" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
  tags ={
    Name = "production"
  }
}
```

2) **Create VPC Internet Gateway**
- [Terraform docs for VPC Internet Gateway](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/internet_gateway)
```bash
resource "aws_internet_gateway" "gw" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id

  tags = {
    Name = "main"
  }
}
```

3) **Create custom route table**
- [Terraform docs for route_table](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/route_table)
```bash
resource "aws_internet_gateway" "gw" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.prod-vpc.id
}

# Custom route table
resource "aws_route_table" "prod-route-table" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.prod-vpc.id

  route {
    # Defualt route, send all tarfic
    cidr_block = "0.0.0.0/0"
    gateway_id = aws_internet_gateway.gw.id
  }

  route {
    # Same for IPv6, send all tarfic
    ipv6_cidr_block        = "::/0"
    egress_only_gateway_id = aws_internet_gateway.gw.id
  }

  tags = {
    Name = "Prod"
  }
}
```

4) **Create a subnet**
- [Terraform docs for subnet](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/subnet)
```bash
resource "aws_subnet" "subnet-1" {
  vpc_id     = aws_vpc.prod-vpc.id
  cidr_block = "10.0.1.0/24"
  availability_zone = "eu-central-1"

  tags = {
    Name = "Prod-subnet"
  }
}
```

5) **Associate subnet with route table**
- [Terraform docs for association between a route table and a subnet](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/route_table_association)
```bash
resource "aws_route_table_association" "a" {
  subnet_id      = aws_subnet.subnet-1.id
  route_table_id = aws_route_table.prod-route-table.id
}
```

6) Create Secuirty group to allow port 22,80,443
- [Terraform docs for Secuirty group](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/security_group)
```bash
# Secuirty group to allow port 22,80,443

resource "aws_security_group" "allow_web" {
  name        = "allow_web_traffic"
  description = "Allow web inbound traffic and all outbound traffic"
  vpc_id      = aws_vpc.prod-vpc.id

  tags = {
    Name = "allow_web"
  }

  ingress {
    description = "HTTPS"
    from_port   = 443
    to_port     = 443
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  ingress {
    description = "HTTP"
    from_port   = 80
    to_port     = 80
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  ingress {
    description = "SSH"
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  egress {
    from_port       = 0
    to_port         = 0
    protocol        = "-1" # All protocols
    cidr_blocks     = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
    ipv6_cidr_blocks = ["::/0"]
  }
}
```

7) Create a network interface with an ip in the subnet(10.0.1.0/24) that was created in step 4
  - [Terraform docs for network interface](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/network_interface)
```bash
resource "aws_network_interface" "web-server-nic" {
  subnet_id       = aws_subnet.subnet-1.id
  private_ips     = ["10.0.1.50"]
  security_groups = [aws_security_group.allow_web.id]
}
```

8) Assign an elastic ip to the network interface created in step 7
- [Terraform docs for an elastic ip](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/eip)
```bash
resource "aws_eip" "one" {
  domain                    = "vpc"
  network_interface         = aws_network_interface.web-server-nic.id
  associate_with_private_ip = "10.0.1.50"
  depends_on = [aws_internet_gateway.gw, aws_instance.web-server-instance]
}
```

9) Create Ubuntu server and install/enable apache2 as web server
- [Terraform docs for AWS instance](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/instance)
```bash
resource "aws_instance" "web-server-instance" {
  ami           = "ami-023adaba598e661ac"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  availability_zone = "eu-central-1a"
  key_name = "main-key"

  network_interface {
    device_index = 0
    network_interface_id = aws_network_interface.web-server-nic.id
  }

  user_data = <<-EOF
                #!/bin/bash
                sudo apt update -y
                sudo apt install apache2 curl -y
                sudo systemctl start apache2
                # Create directory for website files
                sudo mkdir -p /var/www/html
                # Download HTML file from GitHub (This URL points directly to the raw content of a file)
                sudo curl -o /var/www/html/index.html https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mz19933/Terraform_AWS/main/HTML/index.html
                # Download CSS file from GitHub
                sudo curl -o /var/www/html/styles.css https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mz19933/Terraform_AWS/main/HTML/styles.css
                EOF
  tags = {
    Name = "web-server"
  }
}
```
## Important notice
These steps achieve our initial goal - using TF to Deploy an AWS service.
Also as you can notice, we stuck as much as possible to the available free AWS tier resources, obviously with some limitations.

For the sake of further implementing improvements and enchantments, some resources are just not available for free, or I would highly recommend against getting them for "free" (Example: Domain registration).

I will continue this guide by using the combination of best and lowest cost possible solutions, follow along at your own discretion.

###   Project's steps part 2 ⚒️
So now that we have a working basic ec2 instance that can serve as web server, now what?
Well, the sky is the limit, or maybe not? 🙂

In line with best practices, first of all I want to fixate a proper DNS name for our service.
For that we will need a couple of things - 
* Domain registerd for the name of our service
* Proper dns record that points to our service

Obviously there are multiple ways of achieving it, in the spirit of using AWS I will base my solution on it.

You don't have to, in case you prefer another provider.(such as GoDaddy, Cloudflare etc')

10) Create the A record in Route 53 if an Elastic IP exists
- [Terraform docs for an aws_route53_record](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/route53_record)
```bash
resource "aws_route53_record" "a_record" {
  zone_id = var.zone_id  # Enter your Route 53 zone ID here
  name    = "level-up-devops.com"
  type    = "A"
  ttl     = "300"
  records = [aws_eip.one.public_ip]  # Assuming you have an Elastic IP resource named "one"
}
```
**Just as we don't hard code our credentials into TF itself but pass it securely, the same will be for our zone_id, which is sensitive information.**

You will need two config files -
* variables.tf
```bash
# variables.tf

variable "zone_id" {
  description = "Route 53 Hosted Zone ID"
  type        = string
}
```
* variables.tfvars
```bash
# variables.tfvars
zone_id = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"  # Replace with your actual Hosted Zone ID
```
